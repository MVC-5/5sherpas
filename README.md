## Project 3 Proposal.

_Group Members:_ Josh Zappone, Luke Shepherd, Caleb Kirkish, Jon Phoenix, and Dan Gillette

_User Story_
As a person who struggles with various aspects of wellness, I want a guide to help me take constructive steps to improve my life so that I can realize my goals and the qualities I want my life to reflect.

_Proposed Application_
Our app would start the user experience by gathering info on the user's goals. It would then generate random suggestions on constructive activities that are based on those goals that the user can select from. At the end of each day, the user will provide a numeric rating as to their level of contentment in life. These ratings will be used to help the user track their progress.

_Proposed Tech Stack_

- MongoDB/Mongoose
- SemanticUI React Components
- D3/Charts
- PassportJS
- ReactJS
- Node/Express Web Server
- Heroku
- MVC Paradigm
